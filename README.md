This is not my sample README.md from the challenge. The sample is located in the main folder with my js files and is also the one displayed in demo video.

## Description
Having a README generator is awesome! This project is beneficial for all coders. This can save a coder time in finding a README.md guide, and having prompts kind of activate your mind and interaction, putting you in code mode. 
Figuring out the rendering of the license badge was the hardest part in this challenge. Thankfully there was hit on google, leading me to lukas-h, and it helped things start chugging along. 

## Installation
Either copy and paste my files in a code editor or fork my files. 
Have node.js downloaded, and a reliable command line.

## Usage
Assuming you have forked or downloaded my files and have access to node.js,
Open main folder in a command line application.
Type node index.js
There you will be prompted for information to create README.md.
You will be prompted to enter a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, provide credits, select a license, contribution guidelines, test instructions, and it will ask to for your github username and email incase there are questions. Then your readers can contact you by those basis. 
If successful you will recieve 'README.md successfully generated!'  if not, an error will show on console. 
Upon sucession, a README.md will create in the main folder, and the answers will display in corresponding spaces. When you view the file in github, the table of contents can jump to targeting areas, and license badge will show near title, and will show a link for further information on the license. 
If you entered a correct github username it should create a link that can navigate to your github page.
